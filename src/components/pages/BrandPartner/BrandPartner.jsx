                About a decade ago, I congratulated myself for something that
                would later put my life through a furnace, something that would
                change my path, and something that would end up setting some
                record for the Nigerian Real Estate Stakeholders . . . moving to
                the Lekki-Ajah axis for a real estate agent job. Although I've
                been a professional Real Estate Surveyor and Valuer, at first,
                it was so exciting being an agent, but soon followed by a lot of

              For every property you see around, there is a soul attached to it.
              If the property is "alive", the soul breathes, and if the property
              is "not alive", the soul is depressed and weakened. That's to
              remind you that when there are property losses or inefficient
              space designs, it wouldn't just be about the monetary losses, it
